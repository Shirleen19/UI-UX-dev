<h1>About me</h1>
<p> My name is Shirleen Gathungu. I am 19 years old and a Software Engineering student at AkiraChix.Before comingto AkiraChix,I was on a gap year exploring learning about myslef,exploring my thoughts and my interests as well as getting to rest.</p>
<br>
<p>I really enjoy learning at AkiraChix because I am getting to learn very intersting courses that challenge me to think deeply and to have a bette understanding of why world problems arise.This issuch a different way of learning because it doesn't focus on students crumming concepts to get tothe top.It actually teaches you how to read,understand and implement.</p>
<h2>My hobbies and Interests</h2>
<p>On a normal day,Ienjoy sky gazing,reading novels especially mystery and Sci-fiction and I also loving watching movies and youtube videos of paranormal activities.</p>
<br>
<p>Sky gazing makes me feel at peace,Books make me feel like I am in another world apart from reality and movies make me feel like a character living in a bubbled world.</p>>
<h3> My dreams</h3>
<p>I hope to live in Sweden especially in the nothern part.The place is beautiful and serene. I wish to have a stable career in tech working as a robotics engineer/AI engineer/Machine learning engineer/Cybersecurity person/Entrpreneur.My house in the country will be very simple medium sized with beautiful art work all around the house and some nice scent flowing thorugh the room and full warm lights.I'll live alone occassionally inviting friends to come over for sleep overs and house parties. During the weekend I'll be travelling to many places just to see waht places and people are upto. I also hope to discover hidden gems and truths. I also that one day I can collaborate with NASA so that I can go on space. My greatest dream is I hope to find peace and happiness.</p>
